This repo will simply be the spot where I revisit data structures, but with Kotlin instead of Java, where I originally learned them.

Each file will have space and time complexity listed, along with a brief description of the functions.

For the sake of demonstration, I will omit using the built-in container functions with the same name to show that I can override and implement each function on my own. For example, if the structure is implemented using a mutableList, I will avoid using mutableList.iterator() or mutableList.contains() and will write my own implementation as an overridden function.

The end goal is that I will eventually add a GUI that can leverage the backend foundation. I also want to add unit tests for these to flesh out the package.
